Issue-ERC20Token-using-Remix-Solidity-IDE

< My experience >
When I searched for the way to issue ERC20Token on the Internet,
this method came to me at first

In this repository, i just copied codes from openzeppelin repository placed in Github.

I Followed OpenZeppelin repository placed in Github, and ERC20 Standard 

I practiced several functions such as Transfer to/from, Balance of and so on (which appeared the very right side on Browser)

After trying this method, I moved forward dealing with Truffle and Zeppelin,
However, those two tools were a bit difficult for me to use because the version of Solidity upgraded and coding was very different from those of past versions
