Issue-ERC20Token-using-Remix-Solidity-IDE

< My experience >
when i searched for the way to issue ERC20Token on the Internet,
this method came to me at first
I practiced several functions such as Transfer to/from, Balance of and so on (which appeared the very right side on Browser)
after trying this method, i moved forward dealing with Truffle and Zeppelin
However, those two tools were a bit difficult for me to use because the version of Solidity upgraded and coding was very different from those of past versions
